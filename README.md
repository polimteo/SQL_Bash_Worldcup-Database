This freecodecamp project involves three components:

1) worldcup.sql:
   I created the "worldcup" database and its two tables: "teams" and "games".
   
2) insert_data.sh:
   I developed a bash script to insert data from World Cup games (games.csv) into the "games" and "teams" tables using PostgreSQL.
   
3) queries.sh:
   I completed the PostgreSQL query to produce the desired output.
